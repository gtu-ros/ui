Trilobite Fossil,Animalia,Arthropoda,-,Trilobitomorpha,Trilobita, https://www.rockseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/trilobites-in-utah.jpg,"Trilobites are index fossils, which geologists use to infer the ages of rock layers. Trilobites allow geologists to date the rocks in which they are discovered and compare them to other rocks of similar ages from around the world. "
Fish Fossil,Animalia,Chordata,Olfactores,Vertebrata,- ,https://i.pinimg.com/564x/df/74/39/df7439c32fe09e05e369102758843e34.jpg,"We can determine how long life has existed by studying records. We can often figure out how and where they lived, and then utilize that information to learn about past habitats. Animals can't survive without oxygen, hence there aren't any there. The only way a fish or other swimming animal can get fossilized in these conditions is if it dies in oxygen-rich waters above, descends to the stagnant muddy bottom, and is buried by sediments."
Ammonoidea Fossil,Animalia,Mollusca,-,-,	Cephalopoda,https://i.natgeofe.com/n/78185bf0-c02f-4b57-9351-4cd5b53a04c3/ammonite_2309498_16x9.jpg?w=1200,"From dating rocks to verifying the presence of primordial seas, ammonite fossils are an invaluable source of information."
Dinosaur Fossil,Animalia,Chordata,Dinosauria,-,- ,https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/1884823.jpg,"They provide a concrete link to former life, landscapes, and climates. They demonstrate how life, landscapes, and climate have changed over time, as well as how living things have responded."
