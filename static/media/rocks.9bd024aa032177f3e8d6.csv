Snowflake Obsidian,Igneous rock,SiO2,Black,Vitreous,Amorphous,-,https://www.gemdat.org/gallery.php?min=8520,"This rock is a natural volcanic glass containing white 'snowflake' crystal patterns of the cristobalite mineral, resulting from partial crystallization of the glass. Snowflake Obsidian is a variety of Obsidian with a black body color and numerous small spreading cristobalite inclusions."
Thunder Egg,Igneous rock,"SiO2, CaCO3, nH2O","Black, Brown",,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/27030,"Thundereggs are found in rhyolite lava flows. They form in lava from the action of water percolating through porous rock that carries silica in solution. The deposits covered and filled the cavity, first with a darker matrix material, then with an agate or chalcedony inner core. The various colors come from the differences in the minerals found in the soil and rock through which the water passes."

Cristobalite,Igneous rock,SiO2,"Colorless, White, Blue,  Brown, Grey, Yellow","Vitreous, Sub-Vitreous",Tetragonal,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/1155,"Cristobalite is a polymorph of silica that is only thermodynamically stable at temperatures above 1470°C at atmospheric pressures, up to its melting point of 1705°C. It usually persists metastable in silica-rich volcanic and sedimentary environments or even forms at much lower temperatures. May form in cavities, possibly as vapor-deposited crystals or spheres in obsidian or other silicic volcanics."
Quartz,Igneous rock,SiO2,"Colorless, Purple, Red, Black, Yellow, Brown, Green, Blue, Orange,",Vitreous,Trigonal,"Poor, Indistinct",https://www.mindat.org/gm/3337,"Quartz is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silica (silicon dioxide). Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in the Earth's continental crust after feldspar. In igneous rocks, quartz forms as the magma cools. Like water turning into ice, silicon dioxide crystallizes as it cools. Slow cooling usually allows the crystals to grow further."
Obsidian,Igneous rock,SiO2,"Black, Bluish, Mahogany, Golden, Peacock",Vitreous,Conchoidal,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/8519,"Obsidian forms when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly with minimal crystal growth. It is often found on the edges of rhyolitic lava flows known as obsidian flows. These streams have a high silica content which gives them a high viscosity. Obsidian is hard, brittle and misshapen; therefore it breaks with sharp edges."
Pumice,Igneous rock,"SiO2, Al2O3","White,Gray, Light-tan",,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/48576,"Pumice is a type of extrusive igneous rock formed by the discharge of lava with a very high water and gas content from a volcano. The lava becomes foamy as gas bubbles escape. When this lava cools and hardens, the result is a very light rock material filled with tiny gas bubbles. It is usually light in color, indicating an igneous rock with a high silica content and low iron and magnesium content, often classified as rhyolite."
Granite,Igneous rock,"SiO2, Al2O3","Pink, White, Gray and Black",,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/48141,It crystallizes from silica-rich magmas located kilometers deep in the Earth's crust.
Orbiculite,Igneous rock,"Granite, Diorite",-,,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/53500,"Orbicles are concentric, layered, spherical structures composed mostly of feldspars and mafic minerals, formed by rapid nucleation in a magma. In some places they have a core of feldspar or hornblende crystal with excess growths of finer material. Elsewhere they can be almost monomineral (feldspar)."
Rhyolite,Igneous rock,"SiO2, Al2O3",-,,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/48451,A group of extrusive igneous rocks that typically exhibit porphyric and diffusely flow texture with quartz and alkali feldspar phenocrysts in a glassy to cryptocrystalline paste; also any rock in that group; extrusion equivalent of granite. Rhyolite transforms into rhyodacite with decreasing alkali feldspar content and trachyte with decrease in quartz.
Basalt,Igneous rock,"SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO","Grey, Black.",,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/48492,"Basalt is the most common rock on the Earth's surface. The samples are black in color and the air is dark green or brown. Basalt is rich in iron and magnesium and consists mainly of olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase. Most specimens are compact, fine-grained and vitreous. They can also be porphyritic with olivine, augite or plagioclase phenocrysts. The holes left by the gas bubbles can give the basalt a coarse porous texture."
Pegmatite,Igneous rock,"NaAlSi3O8, (K, Na)AlSi3O8, SiO2",-,,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/50315,"An extremely coarse-grained igneous rock with border crystals, often found as irregular cloth, lenses or veins, ESP. In the margins of Batholiths. Most grain diameters are 1 cm or more. Although pegmatites with similar gross compositions to other rock types are known, their composition is usually granitic; The composition can be simple or complex and contain rare minerals rich in elements such as lithium, boron, fluorine, niobium, tantalum, uranium and rare earths. Pegmatites contain high concentrations of minerals that will crystallize the last and most watery portion of a magma and therefore contain high concentrations found only in trace amounts in granitic rocks."

Sandstone,Sedimentary rock,CaCO3,"Yellow, White, Grey",,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/49438,"Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed primarily of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) silicate grains. Most sandstones are composed of quartz or feldspar (both silicates) because they are the most weather resistant minerals on Earth's surface. Rock formations composed mainly of sandstone often allow water and other liquids to seep in and are porous enough to store large quantities, making them valuable aquifers and oil reservoirs. The probability of finding fossils is high."
Mudrock / mudstone,Sedimentary rock,-,"Grey, Yellow, Red, White ",,-,-,https://zh.mindat.org/gm/49442,"Mudstone is an extremely fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of a mixture of clay and silt-sized particles. Terms such as claystone and siltstone are often used in place of mudstone, but they refer to rocks whose grain size falls into much narrower ranges, and on closer inspection they are often technically mudstone. It contains many fossils."

Siltstone,Sedimentary rock,"SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO, Fe2O3",Amber,,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/49448,Siltstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed of grains that are between sandstone and mudstone in size. It can be found in different colors and textures in different environmental conditions. Siltstone is generally red and gray in color and has flat bedding planes. Darker siltstone contains plant fossils and other carbon-rich materials. It is tough and durable and does not break into fine particles or layers easily.
Chalk,Sedimentary rock,CaCO3,Bown,,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/photo-1044206.html,"Chalk is a non-clastic carbonate sedimentary rock in the form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. It is soft, fine-grained and easily pulverized. It is a type of limestone rock that varies in color from white to gray. It consists of the shells of very small marine organisms such as foraminifers, coccoliths and rhabdolids."
Coal,Sedimentary rock,C,White,,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/9353,"Coal is a non-clastic sedimentary rock. They are fossilized remains of plants and are in flammable black and brownish-black tones. Its main element is carbon, but it can also contain other elements such as hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen."
Lignite,Sedimentary rock,C,"Black, Brown",,-,-,https://www.mindat.org/gm/9354,"Lignite, often called brown coal, is a soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock that is naturally composed of compacted peat. It has a carbon content of around 25-35%. Lignite begins as an accumulation of partially rotted plant material or peat. Peat accumulates most easily in areas where there is ample moisture, where the land surface is slowly sinking, and where there is no degradation by rivers or oceans."
